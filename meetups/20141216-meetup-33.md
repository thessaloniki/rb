#### Summary

This season we wanted to be consistent with what we talk about during our meetups. We have started [a Ruby on Rails project](https://github.com/thessrb/thessrbio) where you can participate. Today we'll continue with the application.

#### About the speaker
Theocharis (Haris) Dimitriou is the head of software development and co-founder of [Polyptychon][2] but really just a developer at heart with a great passion about everything regarding technology. He is an IT specialist with over 14 years of experience in software systems implementations, having built various commercial enterprise systems for health, S.M.E.s, education, industry and culture. After years and years of quests in different programming languages he has finally found peace in Ruby-land where he is not fighting any more with his inherent need to change technologies and programming languages just to be happy...

TBD

- [ ] Add references to resources about the main topic of the presentation under "Notes" as a bullet list
- [ ] Prepare video announcement
