#### Summary

Almost every Rails application will interact with a database and new people to
Rails might get stuck on the "M" in the MVC paradigm (model-view-controller). In
this meet up we will: discuss about popular databases, data modeling and
relationships, one to many, many to many and polymorphic (more about the perfect
relationship will be discussed after the meet up with beers), build from scratch
a dead simple application with focus on the model, explore basic tasks such as
storing, retrieving, updating data, recommend tools, gems, discuss challenges in
real-world applications, and more.
