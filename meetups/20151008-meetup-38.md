#### Summary for Microservices

Single and monolithic codebases are hard to evolve and scale. On the other hand, frequently updates to apps are required, even multiple times a day, to meet users' expectations. Thus, Microservices, an architectural style, that is designed to allow easy extensibility, higher maintainability and code collaboration, was introduced. This presentation is an introduction to the bits and bytes of that architecture, its advantages and how it can be adopted to your infrastructure.

#### About Kostas

[Kostas Bariotis](http://kostasbariotis.com) is a Software Engineer currently working at [Goodvidio](https://goodvid.io). His mission is to write clean and efficient code, to solve problems on the Web and to learn something more.

#### Summary for Testing Demystified

Half an hour's discussion on fundamental test concepts. Let us establish a common understanding and vocabulary on things like unit testing, TDD, integration and system testing. What are the different ways of categorizing tests, what should be aware of when using terms such as 'unit test', how much variation is there between different types of projects. All these before we even start drinking beer!

#### About Vassilis

Vassilis Rizopoulos has been dabbling in software engineering for over 15 years now. In this decade and a half what started as a hobby of a would-be electrical engineer became full time occupation. He specializes in "software productivity engineering", a catch all term for the role that integrates the development environment, test automation, continuous integration and deployment, devops and general behind the scenes tooling that enables software teams to concentrate on actually producing useful software. His language of choice is Ruby and has been for the past dozen of years, but he also has several C and C++ embedded projects under his belt as well as a few C# .NET projects. Most of his professional career has been spent working for large industry firms doing really close to the metal stuff, from devices smaller than an Oreo cookie to as large as 60-ton locomotives. He is one of the co-founders and organizers of [thessaloniki.rb](https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/117820512877082997368/117820512877082997368/posts) the Thessaloniki Ruby Users group and also had the luck to be part of the organizing committee for [EuRuKo 2013](http://euruko2013.org) that took place in Athens. Whatever free time remains between deadlines and family life goes into open source projects mainly in the Ruby community with the lion's share reserved for [rutema](http://github.com/damphyr/rutema)
