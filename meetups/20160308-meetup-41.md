#### Summary

We are going to build a Rails 5 application step by step. We are going
to cover the basics, but the application is going to work. This will
give you the opportunity to see how to use Rails to build web
applications. You will learn the basic steps, and it will be really easy
to go back home and start experimenting immediately!

Plus, we are going to show you how to deploy it to Heroku, so that
people can start using it from all over the world. Piece of cake.
