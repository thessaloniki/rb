### Task list for new meetups pull request body template

This is what I use to remember what I need to do every time I start planning a new meetup:

- [ ] Find a date and a place
- [ ] Rename `meetup-%filltext:name=NN%.md` to `YYYYMMDD-meetup-%filltext:name=NN%.md` in the meetups directory
- [ ] Fill in a nice title
- [ ] Fill in a summary of the presentation
- [ ] Fill in the name of the speaker as a link to their GitHub account
- [ ] Fill in a short biography of the speaker
- [ ] Add references to resources about the main topic of the presentation under "Notes" as a bullet list
- [ ] Prepare video announcement
- [ ] Create the meetup.com event
- [ ] Create the facebook event
- [ ] Add the links here
- [ ] Replace first line in README.md with `## MMM DD Meetup-%filltext:name=NN% - A short title`
- [ ] When all above are checked off, merge this
- [ ] Create a git.io URL with code thessrb-%filltext:name=NN% to the permanent link of `YYYYMMDD-meetup-%filltext:name=NN%.md`
- [ ] Add event to [SKGTech Calendar](http://skgtech.io/submit-event/)
- [ ] Go crazy announcing the meetup everywhere
