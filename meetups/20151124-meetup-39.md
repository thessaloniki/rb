Who said you can't have fun developing games using Ruby? I will show you how to develop a quick game using Ruby and a 2D library called gosu.

#### Summary for "Women in tech"

The SheSharp folks will talk about their group, why they formed it, and what they have been doing the during past year. We'll then have an open discussion about diversity in tech or the lack of it, the underrepresentation of women, and the reasons behind this. Finally, we are going to touch our future plans and projects.
