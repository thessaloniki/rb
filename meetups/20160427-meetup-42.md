#### Summary

Bring your laptop. This time we are not going to present anything. We are going to work together on various issues [our Rails 5 application](https://github.com/thessrb/mageriko) has. We are doing this at TechMinistry's open source Wednesdays. We'll code together, mentor you, help you, laugh together, have fun, and then go for drinks (water, coffee, beers) near by (usual place). We hope we leave our application in a better state :).
