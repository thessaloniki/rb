#### Summary
The value of unit tests, TDD and BDD are well documented... everywhere in the internet! Unfortunately, it is still daunting to get started with it. In this presentation we'll see what Ruby ecosystem has to offer, mainly focusing on [minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest) and [RSpec](http://rspec.info/).
