#### Summary for Frameworks and mercenaries
##### Combining weapons to win the battle

Every tool has its strong and weak points. New features and requirements can make your framework feel inadequate. Migrating to a completely different tool is almost never an option. The cool boys use the right tool for the right job, why shouldn't you? We will use a real world production solution, to propose an agile engineering approach to overcoming framework shortcomings and other sticky situations.

Testributor is an online service that will help you with the time consuming aspect of running tests. It will magically slice up your suite and transparently run all its “pieces” in parallel. Testributor is in beta stage. Feel free to break it. It you do, we will send
you a gift.
