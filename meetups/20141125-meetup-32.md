#### Summary

This season we wanted to be consistent with what we talk about during our meetups. We have started [a Ruby on Rails project](https://github.com/thessrb/thessrbio) where you can participate. Today we'll create a few pages, talk about routing, controllers, views, and how to deply our rails application to Heroku.

#### About the speaker

After years and years of quests in different programming languages he has finally found peace in Ruby-land where he is not fighting any more with his inherent need to change technologies and programming languages just to be happy...
