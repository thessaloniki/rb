### Thessaloniki Ruby Meetup (thessrb)

thessrb is a group of (not just) geeks, who love Ruby (among other things),
live (not just) in Thessaloniki (Greece), and meet at least once a month to
throw some presentations (sometimes) and have beers (every time).

### When do you meet?

We have at least one meetup every month. Here are some ways to find out when the
next meetup will be:
